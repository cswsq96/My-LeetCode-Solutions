# 285. Inorder Successor in BST

[285. Inorder Successor in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/) - Medium

## Discription
Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.

 

**Example 1**:

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_1.PNG)

    Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
    
**Example 2**:

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG)

    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
    Output: null
    Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
    
## 解题思路
successor的位置有两种可能性：

+ 如果p的右子树不为空，那么successor就是右子树中的最小节点
+ 如果p的右子树为空，那么sucessor就是p的父节点
    
## Solution 1 - Binary Search

直接搬了leetcode大神的解释，非常到位。

When the code runs into the else block, that means the current root is either p's parent or a node in p's right branch.

If it's p's parent node, there are two scenarios: 1. p doesn't have right child, in this case, the recursion will eventually return null, so p's parent is the successor; 
2. p has right child, then the recursion will return the smallest node in the right sub tree, and that will be the answer.

If it's p's right child, there are two scenarios: 1. the right child has left sub tree, eventually the smallest node from the left sub tree will be the answer; 
2. the right child has no left sub tree, the recursion will return null, then the right child (root) is our answer.


```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        TreeNode succ = null;
        
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.val > p.val) {
                succ = root;
                root = root.left;
            } else {
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        
        return succ;
    }
}
```
Time Complexity: O(h), h是树的高度，最坏情况是O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
