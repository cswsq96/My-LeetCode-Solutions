# 174. Dungeon Game

[174. Dungeon Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/) - Hard

## Discription
The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
 

Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.

<table>
      <tr><td>-2(K)</td><td>-3</td><td>3</td></tr>
      <tr><td>-5</td><td>-10</td><td>1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>10</td><td>30</td><td>-5(P)</td></tr>
</table>
 
Note:

+ The knight's health has no upper bound.
+ Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

## 解题思路
这道dp比较特殊，是从右下到左上更新的，记录一下。如果按正常bottom-up顺序做也可以做，但是需要多用一个纬度来维护当前生命和这条路线生命最低点，比较麻烦。

## Solution 1 - Dynamic Programming
dp[i][j] = 到达i,j最少有多少血才不会死，比如要求dp[1][1]， 那得知道dungeon[1][1] = -5，dp[1][2] = 5, dp[2][1] = 3, 走到右边不死至少需要5点血，走到
下面一格不死至少需要3点血，那么我们在[1,1]至少需要1 - dungeon[1][1] + min(3,5) = 9点血，也就是dp[1][1] = 9才能不在这一格死亡，且能活到下一格。

```java
class Solution {
    public int calculateMinimumHP(int[][] dungeon) {
        if (dungeon == null || dungeon.length == 0 || dungeon[0].length == 0) 
            return 0;
        int m = dungeon.length, n = dungeon[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        
        // base case
        dp[m-1][n-1] = Math.max(1 - dungeon[m-1][n-1], 1);
        
        // base case rightmost column
        for (int i = m - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][n-1] = Math.max(dp[i+1][n-1] - dungeon[i][n-1], 1);
        }
        
        // base case bottom row
        for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
            dp[m-1][j] = Math.max(dp[m-1][j+1] - dungeon[m-1][j], 1);
        }
        
        for (int i = m - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(Math.min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1]) - dungeon[i][j], 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```
