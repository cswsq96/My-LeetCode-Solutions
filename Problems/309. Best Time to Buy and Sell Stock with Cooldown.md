# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

[309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/) - Medium

## Discription
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

**Example**:

    Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]


## 解题思路
感觉到是dp题目，但是不会写，看了答案也不是特别理解，要品一下。

## Solution 1 - Dynamic Programming
buy[i] 在前i天，最后一个操作是买的情况下，最大利润。（不是第i天买）
sell[i]在前i天，最后一个操作是卖的情况下，最大利润。 （不是第i天卖）

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length <= 1) 
            return 0;
        
        int n = prices.length;
        int[] buy = new int[n+1];
        int[] sell = new int[n+1];
        
        buy[1] = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            buy[i] = Math.max(sell[i-2] - prices[i-1], buy[i-1]);   // 比较卖了再买和不卖哪个利润高
            sell[i] = Math.max(buy[i-1] + prices[i-1], sell[i-1]);  // 比较在前i-1天卖和在第i-1天买了，第i天卖哪个利润高
        }
        return sell[n];
    }
}
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

## Solution 2 - optimized Dynamic Programming
因为dp[i]最多用到了dp[i-2]，可以用4个变量替代dp数组。

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int prevBuy = 0, prevSell = 0, buy = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell = 0;
        for (int price: prices) {
            prevBuy = buy; 
            buy = Math.max(buy, prevSell - price);
            prevSell = sell;
            sell = Math.max(sell, prevBuy + price);
        }
        return sell;
    }
}
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
