# 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

[154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/) - Hard

## Discription
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example 1**:

    Input: [1,3,5]
    Output: 1
    
**Example 2**:

    Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
    Output: 0
    
Note:

+ This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
+ Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
    
## 解题思路
这道题是[153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/cswsq96/My-LeetCode-Solutions/blob/master/Problems/153.%20Find%20Minimum%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array.md)的follow up，
这两道题和[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/cswsq96/My-LeetCode-Solutions/blob/master/Problems/33.%20Search%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array.md)， [81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://github.com/cswsq96/My-LeetCode-Solutions/blob/master/Problems/81.%20Search%20in%20Rotated%20Sorted%20Array%20II.md)
非常相似，连同follow up也都是在原本的基础多了duplicate的存在，follow up的solution也如出一辙。

Note问题回答：在最坏情况下时间复杂度会提高到O(n)，比如所有数字都一样的情况。

## Solution 1 - Binary Search

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right])
                left = mid + 1;
            else if (nums[mid] < nums[left])
                right = mid;
            else
                right--;
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
}
```
Time Complexity: O(logn) worst case: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
