# 443. String Compression

[443. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/) - Easy

## Discription
Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

 
**Follow up**:
+ Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

 
**Example 1**:

    Input: ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

    Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

    Explanation: "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
 

**Example 2**:

    Input: ["a"]

    Output: Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

    Explanation: Nothing is replaced.
 

**Example 3**:

    Input: ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

    Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

    Explanation: Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced 
    by "b12". Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
 

**Note**:

+ All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
+ 1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.

## 解题思路
题目有点意思，想到了用双指针，但是自己写的磕磕绊绊，这里记录一下写的好的答案，代码很清楚易懂，就不解释了。
    
## Solution 1 - Two Pointers
参考： https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/discuss/92559/Simple-Easy-to-Understand-Java-solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int n = chars.length;
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        while (right < n) {
            // 记一下currentChar，这样就避免了right和right-1的比较还要检查right > 0
            char cur = chars[right];
            int count = 0;
            while (right < n && chars[right] == cur) {
                right++;
                count++;
            }
            chars[left++] = cur;
            if (count > 1) {
                // 这里用了toCharArray严格说space不是O(1)了，得用charAt，为了方便就不计较了
                for (char c: Integer.toString(count).toCharArray()) { 
                    chars[left++] = c;
                }
            }
        }
        // left的index刚好就是长度
        return left;
    }
}
```
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
