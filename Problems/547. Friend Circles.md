# 547. Friend Circles

[547. Friend Circles](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/) - Medium

## Discription
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

**Example 1**:

    Input: 
    [[1,1,0],
     [1,1,0],
     [0,0,1]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
    The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
    
**Example 2**:
    Input: 
    [[1,1,0],
     [1,1,1],
     [0,1,1]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
    so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
    
**Note**:
+ N is in range [1,200].
+ M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
+ If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.

## 解题思路
graph的题目，可以用DFS，BFS，也能用Union-Find。

## Solution 1 - DFS
从第一个人开始，把他自己和他朋友都标记为访问过，也就是属于一个朋友圈，再标记他朋友的朋友们，把关系延伸出去，直到无法延伸。
接着再找下一个没有被之前的朋友圈包含的人，也就是没有被访问过的人。

```java
class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        int n = M.length;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int person = 0; person < n; person++) {
            if (!visited[person]) {
                dfs(person, M, visited);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int person, int[][] M, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[person] = true;
        for (int other = 0; other < M.length; other++) {
            if (M[person][other] == 1 && !visited[other]) {
                dfs(other, M, visited);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Time Complexity: O(n^2)，每个顶点最多访问一次吧

Space Complexity: O(n)

## Solution 2 - Union-Find 稍后补

```java

```
Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(n)
